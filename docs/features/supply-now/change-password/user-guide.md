# Change Password — User Guide

**App:** Supply Now
**For:** Clients (Admin, Manager)

## What is Change Password?

You can change your account password at any time from the Profile screen in the Supply Now app.

**Example:** You want to update your password for security reasons, or you shared it with someone and now want to change it.

## How To Change Your Password

### Step 1: Open your profile

Tap the **Profile** tab at the bottom of the screen.

### Step 2: Tap "Change Password"

In the **Personal** tab, find the **Change Password** row and tap it.

### Step 3: Fill in the form

A dialog will appear with three fields:

1. **Current Password** — type your current (old) password
2. **New Password** — type your new password
3. **Confirm Password** — type your new password again

### Step 4: Save

Tap **Save**. You will see a green confirmation message: "Password changed successfully".

**Result:** Your password is now updated. Use the new password next time you log in.

## Password Requirements

Your new password must:

- Be at least **8 characters** long
- Contain at least one **letter** (a-z or A-Z)
- Contain at least one **number** (0-9)
- Match exactly in both "New Password" and "Confirm Password" fields

## Auto-Save Profile

Your profile also has an auto-save feature:

- **Name changes** (first name, last name) save automatically after you stop typing
- **Profile picture** saves instantly when you upload or remove it
- A green message confirms each save

## Tips

- **Tip 1:** Choose a password you don't use on other websites
- **Tip 2:** If you make a mistake, just close the dialog and try again — nothing is saved until you tap Save
- **Tip 3:** Write down your new password somewhere safe until you remember it

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use my old password as the new password?**

A: Yes, the system does not prevent reusing old passwords, but it's recommended to choose a new one.

**Q: Will I be logged out after changing my password?**

A: No, your current session stays active. You'll use the new password next time you log in.

**Q: I forgot my current password. What do I do?**

A: You cannot change your password without knowing the current one. Log out and use "Forgot Password" on the login screen to reset it via email.

## Troubleshooting

### I see "Current password is incorrect"

**Possible reasons:**

- You typed the wrong current password → Double-check and try again
- Caps Lock is on → Turn it off and re-type
- You're confusing accounts → Make sure you're logged in with the right email

### I see "Passwords do not match"

**Try these steps:**

1. Clear both "New Password" and "Confirm Password" fields
2. Carefully type the same new password in both fields
3. Tap Save again
