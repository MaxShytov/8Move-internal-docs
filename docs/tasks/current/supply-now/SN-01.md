# SN-01: Multi-Supplier Verification & Blocking

**ID:** SN-01 (previously BE-01)
**Status:** :material-progress-clock: In Progress
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

## Apps Affected

| App | Role | Impact |
|-----|------|--------|
| :material-server: **Django Backend** | RLA filtering logic | Core — data access layer |
| :material-cellphone: **Supply Now** | Client app | Client sees all linked suppliers |
| :material-monitor-dashboard: **Back Office** | Supplier app | Supplier sees only own clients |
| :material-shield-crown: **Django Admin** | Platform admin | Admin sees all links |

## Description

Verify that the multi-supplier architecture (one client linked to multiple suppliers via `ClientSupplierLink`) works correctly across all three applications:

- **Supply Now** — client sees all their linked suppliers
- **Back Office** — supplier sees only their own clients
- **Admin Panel** — platform admin sees all links between clients and suppliers

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Manual UI testing across all 3 apps (checklist scenarios)
- Automated tests for RLA (Row-Level Access) filtering
- Verify seed data is sufficient for test scenarios
- Test `is_blocked` mechanism
- Test edge cases (0 suppliers, 1 supplier, 5 suppliers)

**Out of scope:**

- Creating new functionality
- Changing RLA logic (verification only)
- Performance testing
- UI/UX improvements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All manual test cases passed (Supply Now, Back Office, Admin)
- [ ] Automated tests written and passing
- [ ] Data isolation between suppliers confirmed
- [ ] Multiple links working (client with 5 suppliers)
- [ ] Blocking mechanism (`is_blocked`) confirmed
- [ ] Seed data sufficient (or supplemented) for all scenarios
- [ ] Issues documented

## Key Risks

| Risk | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Order RLA filtering | :material-alert: High | `Order.rla_roles_filter` filters only by supplier — clients may not see their orders |
| ClientSupplierLink RLA | :material-alert-outline: Medium | No custom `rla_roles_filter()` — API may return empty data for non-admins |
| Blocking gaps | :material-alert-outline: Medium | `is_blocked` may not be checked in all places (orders, products, UI) |
