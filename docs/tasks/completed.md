## How to archive a completed task

1. Move the `CURRENT_TASK_*.md` file to `COMPLETED_TASKS/` with date prefix:
   ```bash
   mv docs/_ai_context/CURRENT_TASK_Feature_Name.md \
      docs/_ai_context/COMPLETED_TASKS/2026-02-14-feature-name.md
   ```

2. Update this page with the new entry

3. Update [Current Task](current.md) with the next task (or mark as "No active task")

4. Complete the [documentation checklist](index.md#phase-6-documentation-for-4-audiences) for all 4 audiences
